# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository.

My name is Ryan. I most enjoy the "making things work" aspect of back end programming.

My favorite language is C++, but Java is a close favorite. I'm well-versed in the aforementioned languages, Python, C#, MySQLi, JavaScript, PHP, CSS/CSS3, HTML/HTML5, and Visual Basic. Although most interested in app dev, I've recently come to have a deep appreciation of web dev and am starting.

In my free time, I like reading mathematics and picking up new coding languages/tinkering with coding exercises. My current read is Euclid's Elements, and the language I'm tinkering with currently is Apple's Swift.
